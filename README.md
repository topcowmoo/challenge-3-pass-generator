# Challenge 3 Password Generator App

<!-- Welcome to my Portfolio project! I made this app from scratch so I could have my own portfolio. I was motivated to make this project so that I could have a place to showcase my work samples. It also serves as a place where potential employers can see what I can do for them. While making this app I learned how CSS flex box is used to further style my plain HTML code. I also had to troubleshoot the index code and style sheet to get the page to function how I wanted. I also made a wireframe for the first time to visualize and plan the structure of my portfolio. Thanks for visiting.

Here is a screenshot of the wireframe. -->
